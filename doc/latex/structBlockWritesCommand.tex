\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{[}\doxylink{structSetStencilCommand}{Set\+Stencil\+Command}\mbox{]} 

This structure represents block writes command. A block write command sets a blocking mask for writes to color, depth and stencil buffer. When a GPU rasterizes a triangle, it produces fragments. These fragments can modify color buffer, depth buffer and stencil buffer. If a blocking mask is set to true, this modifications are disabled. Student should implement correct behaviour of this command. \mbox{[}\doxylink{structBlockWritesCommand}{Block\+Writes\+Command}\mbox{]}
